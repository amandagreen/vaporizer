        up some L.A. Confidential. I have to say Oh my God! I had this strain before
        but it was the green and red hair pheno.. This pheno I got yesterday is the
        purple pheno and let me tell you. The smell is of a pungent,skunk,sourgrape,fuel.
        It tastes as it smells. Not harsh or too pungent tasting.. the high is a bit
        of a kick in the face after smoking the whole spiff.. I give a 5 out of 5!
